Text extraction is a process in which specific information is identified and retrieved from a larger body of text. This can involve extracting key phrases, entities (such as names, dates, and locations), or more complex structures such as tables or formatted data. Text extraction is commonly used in natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval tasks.

Key applications of text extraction include:

Entity Recognition: Identifying and classifying proper nouns within the text, such as names of people, organizations, locations, and dates.
Keyword Extraction: Finding the most important words or phrases within a document.
Sentiment Analysis: Extracting sentiment-related information to determine the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) expressed in the text.
Information Retrieval: Pulling out specific pieces of information, such as prices, product details, or contact information.
Content Summarization: Extracting key sentences or paragraphs to create a summary of the document.
Techniques for text extraction include rule-based methods, statistical models, and machine learning approaches, particularly those involving deep learning and NLP models like transformers.
